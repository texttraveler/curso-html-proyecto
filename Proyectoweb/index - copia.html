                    <div class="articulo">
                        <p>Norway’s 86-year-old King Harald V, who has been in frail health in the past few years, has tested positive for the coronavirus and has mild symptoms, royal officials said on Sunday.</p>
                        <p>“His Majesty the King has been diagnosed with corona and is on sick leave until he is symptom-free. The king has cold symptoms and stays at home,” the royal household said in a brief statement.</p>
                        <p>The Norwegian monarch had also tested positive in March 2022 with mild symptoms. Officials have earlier said Harald had received three COVID-19 vaccine shots but it's not known whether he had received booster shots.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre wished the king “a speedy recovery” in a comment to the Norwegian news agency NTB, which said Harald's son and heir to the throne, Crown Prince Haakon, would take over his duties for now.</p>
                        <p>The aging monarch, who has been seen using crutches in various occasions, has been hospitalized several times in recent years.</p>
                        <p>In August 2022, he spent three days with a fever at a hospital, and in December the same year, he was again admitted for an infection that required intravenous antibiotics.</p>
                        <p>In October 2020, the king underwent surgery to replace a heart valve after being hospitalized with breathing difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Despite health problems, he has been attending major public events in Norway and its Nordic neighbors. In September, Harald attended celebrations in Stockholm marking the 50th anniversary of Sweden’s King Carl XVI Gustaf’s accession to the throne.</p>
                        <p>In May, the monarch, who was released from a hospital just days earlier, appeared on the royal castle’s balcony in Oslo to salute the thousands of children marching by as the country celebrated its Constitution Day.</p>
                        <p>The king is Norway’s head of state but holds no political power, so his duties are ceremonial. Harald ascended to the throne following the death of his father, King Olav, in 1991.</p>

                    <div class="articulo">
                        <p>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Seven of the activists who repeatedly have demonstrated against a wind farm in central Norway that they say hinders the rights of the Sami Indigenous people to raise reindeer met with the Norwegian king on Monday and his son who is heir to the throne.</p>
                        <p>”It was a very strong moment for us — emotionally charged,” activist Ella Marie Hætta Isaksen told the VG newspaper after the meeting with King Harald and Crown Prince Haakon at the royal palace in Oslo. “We experienced not only being believed, but a human meeting with someone who really meets people with compassion and sympathy.”</p>
                        <p>”It makes a world of difference in the face of this state, which is so strong and arrogant and difficult to talk to,” she told the daily.</p>
                        <p>Before the meeting, another activist told Norwegian news agency NTB that “we have nowhere else to go.”</p>
                        <p>At the center of the dispute are the 151 turbines of Europe’s largest onshore wind farm, which is located in Norway’s Fosen district, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) north of the capital, Oslo. The activists say a transition to green energy shouldn’t come at the expense of the rights of Indigenous people.</p>
                        <p>They have protested several times since the Supreme Court of Norway ruled in October 2021 that the construction of the turbines had violated the rights of the Sami, who have used the land for reindeer for centuries.</p>
                        <p>The activists, many dressed in traditional colorful garments, have sat down inside parliament, outside the building in Oslo of the state-owned company that operates 80 of the wind turbines at Fosen, outside the offices of Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy for four days in February. They also have temporarily blocked the entrances to 10 ministries.</p>
                        <p>They had asked for the meeting with the Norway’s monarch, who has a ceremonial role as the country’s head of state. They said they know that the king has no political power. But they have said that “we just want to be listened to.”</p>
                        <p>The palace confirmed the meeting took place and “they presented their view” to the monarch and his son.</p>

                    <div class="articulo">
                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Meta lost a legal battle Wednesday to halt a Norwegian ban on its advertising practices that came with hefty daily fines, in a blow to the U.S. social media giant’s business model.</p>
                        <p>Norwegian regulator Datatilsynet in July announced a “temporary ban” on Facebook and Instagram’s behavioral advertising — a common marketing practice that tech giants like Meta use at the heart of their business models to sell targeted ads based on user data ranging from personal interests to places they’ve been.</p>
                        <p>Such practices without adequate consent violate user privacy and are illegal, Datatilsynet said, adding that the ban was set to last for three months or until Meta complies with the law.</p>
                        <p>During the ban, which began last month, Instagram and Facebook can continue to operate normally in Norway — but if they do, Meta faces a “coercive fine” of up to 1 million Norwegian kroner (nearly $100,000) each day. In efforts to challenge this, Meta applied for a temporary injunction — arguing that the Datatilsynet did not have legal grounds for its urgent decision, citing factors including inadequate notice.</p>
                        <p>But on Wednesday, Oslo District Court sided with the privacy watchdog. The ruling confirms the ban’s daily fine became applicable on Aug. 14 and continues to add up.</p>
                        <p>“We are very pleased with the Court’s ruling and the result. This is a big victory for people’s data protection rights,” Datatilsynet director general Line Coll said in a statement.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, a Meta spokesperson said that the company was “disappointed” by the decision “and will now consider our next steps.” The spokesperson added that the Menlo Park, California-based company already announced plans to shift all users in the European Economic Area to consent law under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
                        <p>A behavioral advertising ban beyond Norway, which isn’t in the EU but part of the European Economic Area, is possible. Datatilsynet says it may take the matter to the European Data Protection Board, the top panel of privacy regulators, which could extend the ban and lead to wider implications across the continent.</p>
                        <p>Meta has been under fire over data privacy for some time. In May, for example, the EU slapped Meta with a record $1.3 billion fine and ordered it to stop transferring users’ personal information across the Atlantic by October. And the tech giant’s new text-based app, Threads, has not rolled out in the EU due to regulatory concerns.</p>
                        <p>Meta is also among the companies that the EU is targeting under new digital rules aimed at reining in the market power of tech giants. In addition to the Facebook owner, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and TikTok parent ByteDance were classified Wednesday as online “gatekeepers” that must face the highest level of scrutiny under the 27-nation bloc’s Digital Markets Act.</p>
